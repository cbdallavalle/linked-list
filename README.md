## Synopsis

A weekend homework assignment for Module 2 of the Front End Program for the Turing School of Software & Design. The test for TDD were given in the repo, meaning students were responsible for passing the POP, PUSH, SHIFT and UNSHIFT tests.

## Code Example

The repo included two files within the scripts directory. The first file contains the node constructor, which takes two properties: data: the information you want the node to store, and next: the next node in the list. The second file contains the linked list constructor, which takes two properties: head: the first node in the list, and length: the length of the list. The constructor also has the methods we are testing for.

## Tests

Tests are run with mocha and chai, using the expect syntax.
